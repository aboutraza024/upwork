Kaneez is the ideal upworker for any data entry or lead generation work you have!\"\n\n\"Kaneez was so efficient, accurate, friendly and to the point. I gave her specific types of people and organizations to search for and requested that she include contact name, phone number, website, email.

And thanks to my thorough understanding of the world of marketing in a time when no one wants to be sold to.\n\nWhile there is a tonne of writing experts out there, you want someone who is that and more.

This means your terrible ol' days of being frustrated over terrible written content are over for good. \n\nWhether it's a sales/web copy that move your audience to jump into action, or articles that leave them informed and engaged, you can trust my writing to evoke the exact kind of intended emotions. \n\nWe can work together to create excellent:\n\n\u2022 Content strategy/revamp\n\u2022 Short/long-form blog articles\n\u2022 Case studies\n\u2022 Comparison pages/articles\n\u2022 Web copy\n\u2022 Product descriptions\n\u2022 SEO content refresh\n\u2022 Social media content\n\u2022 Copy/content edits\n\nMy approach, when creating content that guides users through every stage of the marketing funnel (honestly prefer the flywheel these days though), prioritizes user experience and information gain.

Towhidul is extremely professional and you can tell that he takes pride in his work. He is prompt to reply and gave valuable insights to improve our writing project. I appreciate that Towhidul is not interested in only doing the bare minimum to complete a project. He goes above and beyond in terms of attentiveness and communication. When we realized that the project would be more than the initial scope agreed upon in the contract, he was willing to do the expanded work necessary and I was more than happy to pay him an increased fee to complete said work as he had more than deserved it. We had a collaborative aspect to our project that allowed us to work really well with each other and I never stressed or worried about the work I would receive from Towhidul. The only delays in the project were on my end and Towhidul was very patient with me even though I was the one at fault. On Towhidul's end, he already agreed to a quick timeline, but I was surprised when he completed milestones even faster than the expected timeframe, without lacking quality or attentiveness. I truly cannot say enough good things about Towhidul.\"\n\n\n\"I had the privilege of working with Tow, and I can't express my gratitude enough. Tow is not just a ghostwriter; they are a true wordsmith and storyteller. They took my ideas and transformed them into a work of art. Their commitment to excellence, attention to detail, and ability to capture my voice and vision were truly remarkable. Working with Tow was not just a professional collaboration; it was a creative partnership that resulted in a brilliant piece of writing. I can't recommend Tow highly enough for anyone seeking an exceptional ghostwriter. Thank you, Tow, for your outstanding work!\"\n\n\n\"This was the first time I'd used Upwork. Not only was the platform straightforward to navigate, and the telephone customer service fantastic, but most significantly, my Writer was outstanding! He is skilled, talented, and creative, and his attitude is exceptionally patient and wonderful! He was encouraging and dedicated to helping me create excellent work. His professionalism and dedication to his work were evident throughout the entire process, and I was delighted with the outcome of my project.\"\n\n\n\"Towhidul is a great GW and I enjoyed working with him for this project. As soon as my next outline is finished, I will be reaching out for additional work. He met all deadlines, revised anything requested and was a joy to work with. If you are looking for a great GW look no farther.\"\n\n\n\"I highly recommend hiring Towhidal for any of your writing needs. He just finished ghostwriting an almost 40,000-word non-fiction book for me. His writing was professional. He clearly wrote about each of the items I needed him to address in the book. He finished each chapter in a timely fashion. Each chapter was submitted for my approval. He then made any corrections I requested. After the first couple of chapters, he was able to write the chapters with little to no corrections needed. In fact, the earlier issues with what to include were not due in any way to Towhidal, but to my outline because it was not specific enough. I then started giving him chapter-by-chapter instructions on exactly what I was looking for. He wrote an outstanding book. I look forward to hiring Towhidal to write many more books for me in the future.\"",

Next, I learned website design and development. My specialization is helping businesses grow on Google. See more at Wizerd.com\n\nA quick summary about me ...\n\nI was born and raised in Kansas, traveled and lived abroad for a couple of years after college, spent ten years in California during the startup boom, and moved to St Petersburg Florida to launch Wizerd. My mission is to specialize in serving growing businesses at an affordable price. I also understand the TLC startups and business owners require and this is part of everything I do.\n\nA longer back story ... I come from generations of small business owners. My great-grandfather, grandfather, grandmother, and parents were all small business owners. I started my first business at age 16 and never looked back. \n\nFor ten years, I lived in Southern and Northern California, working on startups, SEO, and new technologies. I loved the rush and thrill of new inventions, but something was always missing. And most big tech companies eventually hurt smaller businesses, which goes against my core.\n\nSo \u2026 I had an idea. Leave California, settle in a smaller \u201ccommunity-focused\u201d city, get back to my roots, and start a business specializing in helping growing businesses. In 2019 I found St Petersburg FL and fell in love \u2026 then created Wizerd to fight for the little guys and bring back happiness to business owners.",
